# Project Prototype

This is our Software Lab project goal is to get, store, and show the data from our crops using IoT.

This project has different phases:
1. Data collection is dealt with inside the raspberry pi and processed on it.
2. REST API  the data is transferred to an API that will save our data on a MySQL database.
3. Real native App which will be able to save all the data to the end-user   

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

```
Java 1.8
Python 3.7

### Installing

You need to configure your raspberry client.

```
Running the code inside the Client folder
```

Once that is done you can check on the website that all the data is available


```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
